This is a quick chrome user script (might work in FF too, YMMV) for improving appshopper, the iOS price tracker (appshopper.com).

It makes use of this cool plugin for supporting cross site ajax to fetch data from apple: https://github.com/jamespadolsey/jQuery-Plugins/tree/master/cross-domain-ajax/

Features:
  - Automatically filter out all apps with < 4.0 rating, and/or < 5 reviews.
  - Automatically prefetch 5 pages at a time when browsing. Update pagination controls to move 5 pages at a time.
  - Automatically pull in any in-app purchases from apple and display them in line.
